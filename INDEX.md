# The Sylius Hackathon

> The Sylius Hackathon is finally happening in Paris, France **on 29th March 2025**!  
> The day after the Symfony Live conference.

This page explains how to participate in the event, how to sponsor it, and how to contact the organizers.

📣Please share it with your friends and colleagues!

_Oh, and by the way, [this page is on Github](https://github.com/monsieurbiz/event-sylius-hackathon), it's a hackathon, isn't it?_

**🎉 Be aware! Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner are included! 🤩**

## Where & when is it happening?

Our Hackathon will be nearby the Symfony Live venue, at the Morning Montsouris, a coworking space located at [1 impasse Reille, 75014 Paris](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6ZPDGpqjrbkLaXuE8).

It will take place from 8:30am to 11:30pm.

The hackathon venue is at a walking distance, about 13 minutes, from the Cité Universitaire de Paris.
